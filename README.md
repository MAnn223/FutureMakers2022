# FutureMakers2022

(Days 1 and 2 in folder)

Day 3 Reflection: I learned about linear regression, clustering, and preceptron. 

Day 4 Reflection: I learned about tensorflow, pytorch, and keras

Day 5 Reflection: I learned about neural networks and how they work as well about different activation functions. I worked on learning the steps in a neural network and how forward pass and backward pass work.

Day 6:

Day 7 Reflection: Today I learned about biases in machine learning including the causes, types, and what we can do to try and prevent bias in machine learning models. It was interesting to see an example of how a model becomes biased through the Survival of the Best Fit game simulation.
