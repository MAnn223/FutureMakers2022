Day 3 Reflection: I learned about linear regression, clustering, and preceptron. 

Day 7 Reflection: Today I learned about biases in machine learning including the causes, types, and what we can do to try and prevent bias in machine learning models. It was interesting to see an example of how a model becomes biased through the Survival of the Best Fit game simulation.
